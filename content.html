				    <h1>To See, or Not to See</h1>
					<p class="essay"> “Color is a power which directly influences the soul.” This quote is by Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian painter and 
					art theorist. Indeed, we can find his idea to be true in ways more than one. As Kandinsky has expressed, color is powerful as it can 
					affect our moods, alter our thought process, and, occasionally, influence us to kill and torture others. Colors are such beautiful and 
					interesting elements of life, that it is truly disheartening for me to say that the exact same beautiful element has caused our world 
					such a storm of damage. Color has killed people; it has eaten our souls from the inside, merely because we are blind to its beauty. 
					As the Earth ages, ‘color’ has begun to adopt a new meaning: pain. It kills me to see that ‘colorism’ or Racial Discrimination exists 
					when diversity is so beautiful.<br><br> Taking a stroll in the past, during the Reformation and 17th century, Catholics were already wondering 
					if the ‘Blacks’ and the ‘Indians’ do indeed have souls. From then on, racial assumptions and profiling has not disappeared, and during 
					the time of Charles Darwin, many began to justify their hatred for people with color, and this, in a way, began the much loved “White Supremacy” 
					mindset. Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species” was not a racist theory itself, but philosophers and social scientists were able to make science a 
					reason and basis for their racist claims, as if discrimination without reason was not hurtful enough.<br><br>Racism starts with color, and the 
					problem of colorism is so bright and obvious, it’s blinding. In recent days, the long-ignored topic of racism has finally begun to surface again, 
					as the recent murder of 46-year old George Floyd in Minneapolis, USA has sparked protests and revolutions trying to stop the act of racial injustice. 
					He was killed by the police as one of them, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, even when he did not resist the police, 
					which is literally and figuratively breathtaking. I suppose that if you are colored, you need not utter a single word, for you are not worthy of life. 
					We finally see the problem after a million years of ignorance, so I guess we should throw a very well-deserved and colorful party. Thankfully, our 
					world leaders have done so, so much to help solve this certain issue. It's most likely that they just do not have the time to further explore solutions, 
					as they are too busy with other projects like Mexican walls and dolomite bays. Although, I do have to earn their favor as my solution will need their 
					cooperation as well.<br><br>Before you judge, like how we judge others too quickly for their color, I pray you hear me out. Contrary to popular opinion, 
					I do fancy the thought of being colorblind, as many benefits and mysteries come along with it. In a 2013 study, the University of Edinburgh in Scotland 
					discovered that individuals with red-green colorblindness are better at seeing camouflage! Oh, how fun it would be! Since the UN is powerful enough, 
					they should be able to issue a rule where we all try to acquire color blindness. Due to research, the best type of color blindness in my opinion is 
					tritanopia, where the red, pink, green, and purple colors are enhanced. Of course, not all of us can afford surgery for our eyes, therefore I will 
					suggest a free, easy, and better way of obtaining non-hereditary color blindness. I have not just one solution, but three offers available!<br><br>
					Do you see any sharp, hard object just lying around, unused? It's because you can just stab your eye, and you will have immediately have a 60% chance 
					of getting the rewarding color blindness prize. Though I am unsure if you acquire tritanopia specifically, isn’t it thrilling to see what kind of color 
					blindness you obtain? Although, I wouldn't be too sure if you can even see afterwards due to the blood and pain, but I am certain that the people who 
					were racially profiled were hurt even more, so at least we're now all almost equal. My second offer is for the innocent babies, so they don’t grow up 
					hateful and malicious like their ancestors. It’s called the Shaken Baby Syndrome, and the damage is, thankfully, permanent so the effects will be carried 
					on into adult life. When you have a newborn baby, just shake them violently, and voila! You have a baby who won’t be racist, as they will grow up seeing 
					beautiful colors, instead of the disgusting ones others are so adamant to see. Now, if you want to try something new, there is always bleach or acid that 
					you can pour into your eyes. Maybe if we bleach our eyes, we can hope that we wash away and cleanse the hundreds of years of racism and abuse from our history. 
					Bleach, or Sodium hypochlorite is toxic if ingested, or by dermal or ocular exposure, which should cleanly do the trick.<br><br>Although these are all very 
					nice and exciting, there is always the possibility that you will just lose your vision completely. If we all end up blind, I will have no complaints as it 
					is not like we are separated with our families or killed in front of many, like how the oppressed were before. We will just be losing our eyes, which will 
					ultimately lead to equality, if I may. The saying that love is blind will then become a beautiful and scrumptious reality. I do hope that now you have read 
					this, you have understood that pain is a color that most people choose to not see, and with my efficient solutions, we can drive out colorism and racial 
					injustice as we blind ourselves (literally) from the disgusting tones others are so keen to see, and enhance the beautiful colors the world has yet to offer.</p></div>
