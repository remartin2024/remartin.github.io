							Look around you. Isn't it beautiful? Such colors, such diversity, that we miss why it's so pleasing to the eye.
							The reason why the world looks so alive is because of the different colors, shades, and textures
							that make up and fill what surrounds us. Diversity, difference, and color are all such important
							parts and elements in our life. This is the same concept as the races and cultures that make up 
							the human race. It's so beautiful to see different races and ethnicities together and apart, and yet 
							people still have the audacity to hate others for the sole reason that they are different.</p>

							This website's title is 'Ablaze', and it has two meanings that I thought was fit for my topic. The 
							first meaning is 'burning fiercely', and you will see why that is relevant to my essay topic. I 
							wanted to show that we can burn fiercely with our love and passion for our nation, culture, and race, 
							and not be afraid to show it. After all, there really is no reason to. The second meaning is 'filled
							with strong emotion'. Racial profiling and discrimination is a serious topic that need to be addressed,
							and thankfully, my essay shows one of the best solutions for it. For the second meaning, I wanted to 
							convey that I am ablaze with passion for the hurt and misjudged. The injustice that so many people and races 
							have faced is ten too many, and to think that it started with color is heart-breaking. I do hope that through
							my website and my essay, I will be able to encourage others to speak up and take action against racial profiling,
							as well as to think of other great solutions like the one I have presented in my essay. You may go to the essay 
							using the navigation bar above.
							I hope you enjoy!</p>

				<h2>About Me!</h2>
				<p class="information">
				Hello! I'm Raya Martin, a PSHS-CLC scholar, and I am the author of "To see, or Not to See".
				The essay was actually for an English 3 project, but I found myself very immersed in my topic, 
				which is racism or racial discrimination. I like writing about social issues and concerns
				as I see the need for it to be solved, so I should do what I can to help with the solutions.<br><br> 
				As a 15-year-old, I really like art and music, as well as watching dramas and anime!
				My hobbies include drawing/painting, watching, and sleeping. I live in Angeles, Pampanga.
